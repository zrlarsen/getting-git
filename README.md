# Do you get Git?

The **Objectives** file contains a list of all objectives covered on Monday, Tuesday, and today, but they are out of order.
This is a chance to practice using GitHub, Terminal commands, and Git:

### Fork and Clone this Repo
Create a clone of this repo to your local machine.

### Create new Branches
Create three branches:
* **Monday** branch will be the objectives covered Monday.
* **Tuesday** branch will be the objectives covered Tuesday.
* **Wednesday** branch will be the objectives covered today.

### Push your Repo back to GitHub
* You should make several commits as you work.
* Create a PR of your changes.
